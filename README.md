# HandTracker
This is my second project in the field of computer vision. I wanted to implement a hand tracker, because the main idea was to create
a game for children, where they could interact with the game using just the hand and nothing more. This code includes only the part
necessary to run the hand tracker.
The processing pipeline is quite simple, but it works quite good considering that no machine learning is involved: just raw computer vision.
